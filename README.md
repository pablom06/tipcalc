Percentage of the tip

The output should have total bill including tip, how much each person should pay (assume split evenly).

## Summary

0. Setup new Repo in GitHub Classroom. Make sure there are three files: 1) ReadMe 2) gitignore 3) .py file
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Follow the instructions in Coursera assignment 
3. Run your computer's version of `python3 -m unittest` to see if your code works as expected
4. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your code, and look for the little green check mark on your repo that tells you your tests passed

And onto the to do list getting smaller (sarcasm) each day!
